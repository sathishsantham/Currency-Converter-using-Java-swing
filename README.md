# Currency-Converter-using-Java-swing


This Currency Converter is a simple GUI-based application that helps users convert a given amount from one currency to another. The interface is straightforward, featuring a text field for entering the amount, a combo box for selecting the target currency, and a button to perform the conversion. Once the user clicks the "Convert" button, the converted value is displayed.

The project is built using Java Swing, which provides an easy way to create graphical user interfaces. I used common Swing components, such as JLabel, JTextField, JComboBox, and JButton, to design the interface. The goal was to make it clean, functional, and beginner-friendly.

To handle button clicks, I implemented the ActionListener interface. The main logic runs inside the actionPerformed() method, which is triggered whenever the user clicks the "Convert" button. This method takes the input value, reads the selected currency, performs the conversion, and updates the UI with the result.

Overall, the project was a great way to practice GUI design and event handling in Java. It’s user-friendly and does exactly what it’s meant to do — convert currency with just a click.
